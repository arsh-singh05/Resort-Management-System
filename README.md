# Resort-Management-System

I have built a Resort Management System using the concepts ArrayList, Classes and Objects,
implementing Interface, Inheritance, File Handling with Objects, User Defined Exception and
Exception Handling.
The Atlantis provides a very efficient service to the guests and it’s system is well planned and
organized for the authorities of the hotel to run it smoothly. The system can be used to store
customer details, booking rooms of four different varieties as per customers choice, the number
of guests and ordering food from menu of the Palace for particular rooms.
The Atlantis offers Exotic Suites and Service Apartments. There are two categories of rooms in
the Palace, first class and Business class rooms. The Service apartments consist of a single
bed whereas the Exotic Suites include two beds and some extra luxuries. Depending on the
guest’s choice, they can choose whether they want an AC or a non-AC room, a smoking or a
non-smoking room.
The food menu of NOBU DUBAI contains delicious items that the guests can order such as
Tiger Prawns, Salmon with Caviar, Wagyu Beef Sliders. Complementary activities and services
have been provided by the The Atlantis under all categories of rooms. If the customers change
their mind, they can unBook Roomthe room as well.
The system views different types of features of the rooms and checks for the room availability
as well. During the time of checkout, a bill will be generated which incorporates the room
charges and the food invoice, and produces the final total to be paid. This is a menu-driven
program and it runs until the user exits. File Handling has been used to store the current status
of the Palace, which includes the customer details, booked rooms, and the food ordered from
the menu into a file, as once the program terminates, and when restarted later, the previous
details are not lost. The program reads the file when it restarts to know the previous status of
the Palace. If the user tries to Book Rooman already allotted room, a User defined exception is
thrown. The use of Exception handling has been made to properly deal with any kind of
unexpected issues, making the program definitive.
